# Coding Quiz Built With Web API's

## Description:

This purpose of this application was to build a functional quiz using HTML as the structure, CSS for Styling and Javascript for functionality with the aid of web APIs. The quiz page begins with a starting screen with a short decription about the quiz and a starting button underneath. The user will then click the button and a timer will start counting down from 100. The user will then have 100 seconds to answer all the questions correctly, but if the user chooses an incorrect answer, the timer will subtract ten seconds as a penalty. Once the user is complete with the quiz, they will be presented with their score which is the time remaining in the quiz. The user will then be asked to put their name in a text box and once the user hits the submit button, their score will be saved to the local storage of the browser and will be displayed in the highscores page everytime the user repeats the quiz. They will also have the option to clear the scores and go back to the starting screen from the highscores screen.
